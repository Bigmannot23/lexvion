# Lexvion Compliance Engine 🔏

🚀 **Elevator pitch:** Lexvion ensures provable compliance. It logs evidence of every workflow with cryptographic signatures, bundles the results and provides a self‑serve trust center so regulators and customers can verify your practices without manual spreadsheets.

### Proof‑of‑ROI
- **Audit stress reduced:** Operators can answer compliance questions in minutes instead of weeks by providing signed bundles【805063921201877†L23-L29】.
- **Provable integrity:** Every piece of evidence is hashed and signed, creating an immutable trail【805063921201877†L7-L22】.
- **Reduced overhead:** Eliminates countless hours spent collating logs and screenshots for audits.

### What it does
- **Evidence logging:** Records actions, data and decisions with cryptographic signatures【805063921201877†L7-L22】.
- **Audit bundle generation:** Packages evidence into a downloadable zip for auditors or customers【805063921201877†L7-L22】.
- **Self‑serve trust center:** Hosts a simple web portal where stakeholders can request and download bundles【805063921201877†L23-L29】.
- **Configurable privacy & retention:** Policies define what to store, anonymize or purge.
- **Extensible:** Built on Python and FastAPI; easily integrate with your existing systems【805063921201877†L7-L22】.

### Why it matters
Regulation and customer trust are make‑or‑break. Lexvion turns compliance from a burden into a competitive advantage by making evidence accessible, verifiable and transparent.

### Quickstart
1. Deploy the FastAPI server (container provided) or integrate into your existing stack.
2. Use the provided SDK to log events and actions.
3. Configure privacy policies and storage location.
4. Point stakeholders to the trust center to request audit bundles.
5. See `polished_lexvion_README.md` and `GO_LIVE_CHECKLIST.md` for detailed guidance.

### Operator principles
This project exemplifies automation first (no manual evidence collection), modularity (SDK can be imported anywhere), operator focus (legal and ops teams), and compounding learning (logs feed into other tools like the trading bot).
