# Lexvion Compliance Engine

## Elevator pitch
Ensure provable compliance. Lexvion logs evidence of every workflow with cryptographic signatures, bundles the results and provides a self-serve trust center so regulators and customers can verify your practices without manual spreadsheets.

## Usage
1. Deploy the FastAPI server (container provided) or integrate Lexvion into your existing stack.
2. Use the provided SDK to log events, actions and data.
3. Configure privacy policies and storage locations.
4. Point stakeholders to the trust center to request audit bundles.

## Architecture
- Evidence logging records actions, data and decisions with cryptographic signatures.
- Audit bundle generation packages evidence into a downloadable ZIP for auditors or customers.
- Self-serve trust center offers a web portal for requesting bundles.
- Configurable privacy and retention policies allow fine-grained control over what is stored or anonymized.
- Built on Python and FastAPI; easily integrates with other systems.
